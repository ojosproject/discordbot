# Data Structure

The JSON file will not be publically available, but this document will outline
how the document is structured.

## `readings` key

The JSON file includes a `readings` key that will return an array. The array
returns a `reading` object with the following keys: `title`, `url` and
`assigned_to`.

```json
{
    "title": "Coding accessibility: How Della found her voice with open source AAC",
    "url": "https://github.com/readme/featured/open-source-aac",
    "assigned_to": null
}
```
