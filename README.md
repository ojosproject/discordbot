# Discord Bot

![Ojos Project logo header](./res/vlogo.png)

This Discord bot is for the Ojos Project to organize ourselves.

## Developer Guide

Install the project dependencies by using this command:

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then, get a Discord token from the
[developer portal](https://discord.com/developers). With that token, run this
command:

```shell
echo 'DISCORD_TOKEN="<DISCORD TOKEN FROM WEBSITE>"' >> .env
```

Finally, you can run this bot by running the
[VS Code debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging).
